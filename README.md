# README

This is a clone of Wealthsimple (the popular Canadian robo-advisor app) built in Rails 6. Upon completion, it will let the user:

- Create an account
- Complete a survey that sets their risk tolerance
- Create mock deposits

The app will automatically convert the user's deposits into holdings based on their risk tolerance.
